## Neural Networks from Scratch
A collection of neural network implementations built entirely from the ground up. This repository serves as my personal learning lab for understanding deep learning fundamentals without high-level abstractions like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Project Goal
The primary objective is to peel back the "black box" of modern machine learning libraries. By using only NumPy for linear algebra and Pandas for data handling, I am manually implementing every component—from weight initialization to backpropagation.

## Tech Stack
Language: Python
Core Libraries:
NumPy: For matrix operations and vectorization.
Pandas: For dataset manipulation and preprocessing.
Visualisation: Matplotlib / Seaborn (for plotting loss curves).
